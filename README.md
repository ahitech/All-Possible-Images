# All-Possible-Images
A small GUI application for Haiku, inspired by "allPossibleImages" program by Douglas Irving Repetto for BeOS.

I have contacted the creator of "allPossibleImages" and received his blessing for my derivative work:

> Dear Alexey,
>
> Thank you so much for writing! I am the author of aPI. It's nice to hear that it has been your companion for so long. Every once in a while I check in on Haiku to see how it's going.
>
> I'm attaching the source code for aPI. It says genki.0605, I'm not sure what I meant by that when I named the folder. It might be useful to you in some way, if only to see what my approach was so many years ago! You're welcome to use / recompile this code in any way that's interesting.
>
> Thanks again for taking the time to contact me.

> Douglas
